Usually, your Ethereum Address is generated by your wallet. This randomly
generated Address will look something like this:
<blockquote>0xcf113456a4b95327ddc55d0a0e127b1febc1e86c</blockquote>
Quite boring huh? Thank god a Vanitygenerator for Ethereum exists! Using this
specialized tool, you can customize the first few characters of your Address.
Here are some examples:
<blockquote>
  0x0000012aaa1915552fa84992123c9948cc19f4b6
  0x666924EFfF81B3999834d57a2d92a6c46763aa04
</blockquote>
Now that looks special, doesn't it? Let's get started on how you can quickly
create your own ETH vanity address.

<strong>Step 1: Install Node.js &amp; NPM</strong>

To run the desired tool, you first need to install Node.js and Node Package
manager. If you are a developer, chances are you already have those.

<a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/v9.3.0/">Install node.js</a>

<strong>Step 2: install vanity-eth</strong>

Open up Node.js console and type the following:
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
  <pre>
$ npm install -g vanity-eth
$ vanityeth -i b00b5</pre
  >
</div>
<strong>Step 3: Create a custom ETH Address using vanity-eth</strong>

Remember you can use any Hexadecimal Characters:
<strong>0-9, a-f &amp; A-F</strong>

Generate 10 random addresses:
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
  <pre>$ vanityeth -n 10</pre>
</div>
Generate 10 addresses starting with 0x0000:
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
  <pre>$ vanityeth -n 10 -i 0000</pre>
</div>
You can also add more or fewer characters it will take exponentially longer the
more characters you add. So while "-i b00b5" might only take an hour to
complete, "-i b000b5" could take a whole day! &nbsp; Tipp: To get your desired
Address you can let it run overnight and store its outputs to a file by
appending†the command with "-l" like this:
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
  <pre>$ vanityeth -n 200 -i 0000 -l</pre>
</div>
If no path is defined the text file will be generated
at:†C:\Users\YourUser\VanityEth-log.txt using the above i was able to get lucky
and find:†<em>0x0000012aaa1915552fa84992123c9948cc19f4b6 </em>even though i only
entered four 0's as filter.

<strong>Step 4: Import Address to test it out or Cold store it.</strong>

Addresses generated by VanityEth†are compatible with any ETH Wallets that allow
for importing plain private keys. We recommend:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://lykke.com">Lykke Wallet</a></li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/#view-wallet-info">MyEtherWallet</a>
  </li>
</ul>
Using MEW you can also export the address in any desired format to import it in
ever more places. f.e. as JSON,†Mnemonic Phrase, Keystore file, TREZOR / Ledger
Wallet / Digital bitbox. [caption id="attachment_869" align="aligncenter"

  test sending and receiving using a small amount to make sure it works
  properly!
