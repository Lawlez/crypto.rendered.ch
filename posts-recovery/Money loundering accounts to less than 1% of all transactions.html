  from the joint
  <a href="https://crypto.rendered.ch/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> analysis team of
  <a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/">FDD</a> and Ellicit, a Bitcoin
  forensics company, indicates that less than one percent of all Bitcoin
  transactions involve
  <a href="https://crypto.rendered.ch/tags/money-laundering">money laundering</a

<strong
  >The report, written to help analyze the flow of funds and the danger of money
  laundering, has indicated that money laundering isnít nearly the problem some
  critics of cryptocurrency believe. The report states:</strong

<strong

    >ìThe amount of observed Bitcoin laundering is small and darknet
    marketplaces such as Silk Road and, later, AlphaBay are [generally] the
    source of almost all of the illicit Bitcoins laundered through conversion
    services.î</em
  ></strong

<strong
  >The report also indicates that the vast majority of illicit transactions
  using Bitcoin were processed in Europe, receiving more than five times as many
  illicit transactions as North America.</strong
>

<strong>AML processes must improve</strong>

<strong
  >The report suggests that the best way to combat such illicit activity is
  through more stringent anti-money laundering (AML) measures. The report states
  that the only way to manage the illicit transaction is for ìFinancial
  authorities in all jurisdictions [to] increase AML enforcement.î</strong
