These days there are many companies offering Ethereum Wallets, which can lead to
confusion as for whats the difference and which one is the right for you.

<i
  >So after reading this post, you should be able to decide yourself what best
  suits your needs.</i

First, let me compare some popular wallets from the mobile &amp; PC platforms.
In addition, I'll add my opinion for each one.
<i>As always I have tested and used all of them. </i>

  creation is crucial to deploy new Dapps. As the official wallet, it is updated
  recently and open source. </i

    >I would recommend this to any Advanced users or people looking for the most
    versatile solution.</b

  currencies like ETH BTC Zcash etc.</b

<h2><a href="https://www.lykke.com/">Lykke Wallet</a> (iOS &amp; Android)</h2>

  src="https://crypto.rendered.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_5767.jpg"

<i
  >Lykke probably the most beautiful and user-friendly of them all. The
  integrated exchange lets you invest in multiple coins from one app.</i
>

<b
  ><i
    >I would recommend lykke to anyone looking for an easy way to get started
    right away with only 1 account. (Also its the go-to exchange for any swiss
    citizens)</i

<h3>
  Ethereum wallet by Freewallet(ios &amp; android) (<b
    >Not recommended - just as an example for a bad wallet</b
  >)
</h3>
<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Easy to use</li>
  <li>Features a price history graph for ETH</li>
  <li>Detailed transaction history</li>
  <li>Easy access via Account(e-mail)</li>
  <li>Allows to buy ETH with credit card</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wallet is stored online</li>
  <li>User holds no private keys</li>
  <li>Keys stored online = they have control over your money</li>
  <li>Prone to hacking</li>
</ul>
<i
  >Freewallet is a good example why the first thing that pops up on the app
  store is not always the best thing.
</i>

<b><i>I would recommend Freewallet to no-one.</i></b>

<h2>
  <a href="https://www.blockwallet.eu/">Blockwallet</a>(IOS &amp; Android)
</h2>
<img

  src="https://crypto.rendered.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_5763.jpg"
  width="750"
  height="504"

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Easy setup</li>
  <li>Allows you to print paper wallet</li>
  <li>User holds keys</li>
  <li>Supports erc20 Tokens(have to be manually added)</li>
  <li>
    Detailed transaction history ( Txn ID, gas price, gas cost, fee cost, sender
    &amp; receiver address)
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>User cannot configure gas price</li>
  <li>cannot import existing wallet</li>
</ul>
The USP of Blockwallet would probably be its ability to print paper wallets.

<b
  >That's why I would recommend this wallet to anyone wanting to invest and
  long-term hold.

<h2>
  <a href="https://metamask.io/?ref=motiongraphics.blog">Metamask</a>(Google
  chrome Extension)
</h2>
<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Easy to setup</li>
  <li>Can be run on testnet</li>
  <li>Allows user to use Decentralised applications</li>
  <li>User holds all keys</li>
  <li>Gas prices and message contents can be adjusted</li>
  <li>Detailed transaction history</li>
  <li>Erc20 token support(manually added)</li>
  <li>Stores all data locally</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Beta software</li>
  <li>Can be slow at times or crash</li>
</ul>
Metamask is not your conventional Wallet it's actually much more than that. Once
more Dapps will be released Metamask will become more and more viable as it can
talk directly to them.

<b
  >I would recommend Metamask to any traders and advanced users looking to trade
  on Decentralised platforms &amp; use other Dapps.</b

    >No Exchange is a safe way to store coins. you do NOT have control over
    them.</b

<h2>Its Time to choose Your Wallet</h2>
The above list should allow you to decide which one fits your needs the best.
The only thing you should ALWAYS make sure for ANY wallet is that you &amp; only
you have access to your private keys!
<h3><b>So what did you choose? Let me know in the comments! </b></h3>
I for myself recently moved most funds to Lykke. As a Trader and Developer I
also frequently use Metamask &amp; Mist. Now that you have your wallet its time
to fund it! Head over to
