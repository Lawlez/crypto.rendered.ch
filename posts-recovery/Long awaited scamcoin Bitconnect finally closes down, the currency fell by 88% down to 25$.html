Bitconnect has <u>formally closed its lending platform and cryptocurrency exchange</u> following warnings from Texas and North Carolina regulators. The Bitconnect Coin (BCC) digital currency is down 87% today and 93% from its December 29 high of $437. At press time, BCC is trading for just $30.
<h2><strong>Bitconnect Coinís website describes the currency as:</strong></h2>
<h2><strong><em>ìThe moment you acquire BitConnect Coin it becomes an interest-bearing asset with 120% return per year. It is that simple.î</em></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Unfortunately for investors, that ìinterest-bearing assetî is now nearly worthless.</strong></h2>
<h2>The ponzi scheme we warned you about</h2><strong>Since its inception in January 2017, many were skeptical about Bitconnect services. In essence, one needed to send Bitconnect Bitcoin in exchange for Bitconnect Coin (BCC) on their exchange.</strong>

<strong>The lending scheme was the main draw card of Bitconnect because of its huge promise of returns. In order to participate in the scheme, you had to buy BCC - which saw the token hit an all-time high of $437.31 per BCC before it plummeted in value following the closure this week.</strong>
